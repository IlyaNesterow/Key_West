It is one of the most visited and photographed attractions in the United States. The southernmost point was originally marked with a small sign, before the City of Key West erected the now famous concrete buoy in 1983. The concrete buoy has overall withstood several hurricanes and is a gathering place for photographs and tourists. The paint job was damaged by Hurricane Irma in September 2017, but it was refurbished later that year by the original artist supported by the City of Key West which values the landmark as a tourist attraction. Cuba is roughly 90 miles south of this point in Key West, although this was not originally on the marker, but rather on a smaller sign next to marker.","images":["https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/18/The_Southernmost_Point%2C_90_miles_to_Cuba-_Key_West%2C_Florida_%288379456437%29.jpg","https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/99/SOUVENIR_SEASHELLS_FOR_SALE_AT_THE_SOUTHERNMOST_POINT_OF_THE_UNITED_STATES_-_NARA_-_548545.jpg"],"descriptions":["The bouy","Tourists in Hemingway house"]},{"url":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/74/Southernmosthouse.jpg","factType":"Historic mansion","index":2,"content":"The Southernmost House is a historic mansion in the U.S. city of Key West","color":"rgba(15, 5, 80, 0.8)","href":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southernmost_House","place":"mansion","topic":"The southernmost Mansion","additionalInfo":"The Southernmost House is a historic mansion in the U.S. city of Key West, in Monroe County, Florida.

Construction of the fort began in 1845 as part of a mid-19th century plan to defend the southeast coast through a series of forts after the War of 1812. Thompson Island, at the southwest tip of Key West, was selected as the site for the fort in 1822 and plans for the fort, drawn up by Simon Bernard and Joseph G. Totten, were approved in 1836. In 1947, the fort, no longer of use to the U.S. Army, was turned over to the U.S. Navy for maintenance. In 1968, volunteers led by Howard S. England excavated Civil War guns and ammunition buried in long-abandoned parts of the fort, which was soon discovered to house the nation's largest collection of Civil War cannons. Fort Taylor was therefore placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1971 and designated a National Historic Landmark in 1973. Due to the filling in of land around the fort, including the creation of an attractive stretch of beach, the park now occupies 87 acres (352,000 mÂ²).","images":["https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3f/Fort_taylor.jpg","https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c6/Aerial_view_of_Fort_Zachary_Taylor_State_Park.jpg","https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8b/Fort_Zachary_Taylor.JPG"],"descriptions":["Fort Taylor, Florida by Seth Eastman (1808-1875)","Aerial view of Fort Zachary Taylor State Park","The fort as seen from the Gulf of Mexico"]},{"url": "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/25/Key_lighthouse.jpeg","factType":"Key West Lighthouse","index":7,"content":"The first Key West lighthouse was a 65-foot (20 m) tower completed in 1825.
