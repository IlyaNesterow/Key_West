            A drive through the Florida Keys and Key West is one of the best scenic road trips in the USA. Only one road connects the 161-kilometer-long island chain: It began as Flaglerâ€™s Railroad, became the legendary Overseas Highway and now has been designated an All-American Road under the National Scenic Byways program. The drive has magnificent scenery, significant historic value and an abundance of recreational opportunities, making it a vacation unto itself.
